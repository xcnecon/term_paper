For data cleaning, please first run clean_sp.do, and then run clean_nipa.do.   
For data analysis, run rolling_window_var to generate prediction series, but it might take you minutes. Then run eda.do for exploratory data analysis, analysis.do for var and regressions based on the results of the rolling-window var. Finally run robustness.do for the tests in the robustness check section.
